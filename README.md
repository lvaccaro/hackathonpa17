How to write Smart Contract? how deploy? which environment? private testnet? 
Make Smart Contract in \<24h. HackathonPA17, Rome 2017.

## Summary
A Smart Contract is a script code for Ethereum transaction in order to make an action (block / unblock money). 
In the Ethereum transactions there is a specific output field to contain the script.
The purpouse of this tutorial is to make a little introduction of the smart contracts environment for a fast and light execution and a daylife of a smart-contracts-developer.
I wnat explain also some tricks and errata corrige learned in Blockchain PA 2017 EY Hackathon, Rome 2017. 

## Documents
We discuss the following environments:
* Solidity: write your contracts in Solidity language.
* Truffle: light framework environment to run/deploy/test your contracts.
* Web3: nodejs library to connect your work into ethereum network, compile/deploy contracts and send transactions.
* TestRPC: an ethereum peer node for test.
* Ethereum Azure: how to deploy an ethereum full distribution on Azure platform.

## Conclusion
My personal opinion on Smart Contract is more like a cool game tool.
